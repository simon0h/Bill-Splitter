# Bill Splitter

## **About**
A personal project of mine, built using React.

I wanted to learn React, and I've always wanted to build a bill splitter that worked the way I wanted it to so here it is.

To do's can be found in the Issues tab.

Hosted here: https://main.d35vpaxee3fzyl.amplifyapp.com

## **Technologies used**
This web app uses:
* React (JSX, HTML, JavaScript, CSS)
* Hosted on AWS Amplify
* Favicon by Stable Diffusion

## **Note**
I initially started in this repo: https://github.com/simon0h/Bill-Splitter-Old, but the package-lock.json file had a lot of out of date dependencies and I was getting a lot of spooky vulnerability alerts from Dependabot. But I couldn't figure out how to update them, so I just said fuck it and created a new repo, copied over all the code, and changed the name to "Old". This one doesn't have any Dependabot alerts, so I guess that worked ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
